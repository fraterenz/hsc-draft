# README
Code to regenerate the figures for the preprint [ADD LINK HERE](https://github.com/fraterenz/hsc-draft).

Instructions to reproduce each figure can be found in the following jupyter notebooks:
- `sde.ipynb`
- `abc/posteriors.ipynb`
- `dynamics.ipynb`

## Requirements
1. The Rust binary [hsc](https://github.com/fraterenz/hsc/releases) simualting the stem-cell dynamics (**TODO**: update link)
2. A Python environment preferably named as `hsc-draft` (see below) (requires Python greater or equal to 3.9)

### 1. The Rust binary
Either download the binary directly according to your operating system [hsc](https://github.com/fraterenz/hsc/releases) (**TODO**: update link) or download the [source code]((https://github.com/fraterenz/hsc) and compile it (requires Rust to be installed).

### 2. The Python enviroment
A Python environment preferably named as `hsc-draft` which requires Python greater or equal to 3.9.

A way to do it:
- do this
- do that
- etc...

Finally, on the cluster, make this env availbale as a ipython kernel.
